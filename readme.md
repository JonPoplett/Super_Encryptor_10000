## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**

This tool is for **educational and experimental purposes only**. While it demonstrates robust theoretical security, it is not a replacement for established cryptographic standards like AES-256. **Do not use this tool for securing sensitive or production data.**

---

## üß† **How It Works**

The custom encryption algorithm:
1. **Fractal Layers**: Applies multiple layers of transformations for increased complexity.
2. **Mediator Key**: Generates a unique key for each encryption.
3. **Randomization**: Incorporates pseudo-random operations to ensure high entropy.

Statistical tests and visualizations validate the algorithm's robustness, including randomness, collision resistance, and pattern immunity.
