# A Fractal-Based Dynamic Encryption Protocol

## Overview

This encryption protocol leverages a recursive fractal approach combined with a hashed mediator term to generate a dynamically scalable, secure encryption method. The main components are the **Mediator Term**, **Fractal Layers**, and **Universal Message Seed**, all of which contribute to a vast search space, making the encryption highly resistant to brute-force attacks.

## Components of the Protocol

### 1. Mediator Term
The **Mediator Term** is central to this encryption scheme, acting as a harmonizing factor that enables both encryption and decryption. It is derived from the combined characteristics of the input message, a universal encrypted message, and recursive fractal interactions. By hashing these values, the Mediator Term compacts and secures the encryption metadata, allowing for a reversible transformation.

### 2. Fractal Layers
Fractal layers introduce complexity through recursive scaling, enhancing the dynamic adaptability of the encryption. Each fractal layer represents a unique set of interactions among variables, which scales exponentially with additional layers. This recursive structure provides a potential keyspace that can expand far beyond traditional encryption methods such as AES-256, offering robustness even against quantum computing advancements.

### 3. Universal Message Seed
A universal encrypted message (or seed) serves as a constant, deterministic base for each encryption process. This message seed allows consistent recreation of initial conditions necessary for decryption and ensures that the combined seed (used to generate randomness) reflects both the specific message characteristics and universal properties, adding to the security.

## Detailed Breakdown of the Encryption Protocol

### Step 1: Mediator Term Generation

The `mediator_term()` function generates the Mediator Term as follows:

- **Random Seed Calculation**: A `combined_seed` is derived by summing the byte values of the input message and the universal encrypted message, setting a fixed state for the randomness generator.
- **Fractal Layer Mapping**: Each byte in the message is mapped to a fractal layer and assigned a unique position within the layer, creating a matrix of interactions.
- **Mediator Information Hashing**: The mappings are serialized as JSON, sorted, and hashed with SHA-256 to produce a compact mediator key, representing the Mediator Term as a fixed 256-bit hash.

This hashed mediator term, combined with the `combined_seed` and the number of fractal layers, forms a unique string that allows decryption to recreate the necessary encryption parameters.

### Step 2: Interaction Generation

The `generate_interactions()` function generates potential interactions based on a specified number of variables and fractal layers. The goal here is to produce a fixed number of unique interactions (256) to map the fractal structure.

1. **Combinations and Permutations**: Combinations of variable names are created, with both additive and multiplicative interactions for variety.
2. **Layer Indexing**: Each interaction is tied to a specific fractal layer, providing unique behavior for every level of complexity in the encryption.
3. **Limiting Interactions**: The function stops once 256 interactions are generated, aligning the encryption’s internal mappings with typical ASCII constraints.

### Step 3: Universal Encrypted Message Seed

The function `universal_encrypted_message()` generates a constant encrypted message seed. This message seed contributes to the `combined_seed` calculation, ensuring that each message has a unique starting state for randomness.

### Step 4: Encryption Process

The `encrypt_message()` function carries out the encryption using the following steps:

1. **Message Encoding**: The input message is converted to a list of byte values, which form the basis of the encryption process.
2. **Mediator Key Calculation**: A single mediator key string is generated by calling `mediator_term()` on the message bytes, the universal seed bytes, and the interactions. This key combines the hashed mediator value, the combined seed, and fractal layer count.
3. **Byte Encryption**: Each byte of the message is encrypted by adding the integer representation of the hashed mediator value to the byte value and taking modulo 256. This ensures each byte remains within the byte range (0-255).

The function returns the encrypted byte list and the mediator key, which will be used for decryption.

### Step 5: Decryption Process

The `decrypt_message()` function reverses the encryption process by:

1. **Splitting the Mediator Key**: The mediator key is split into its three components—the hashed mediator value, combined seed, and fractal layers.
2. **Re-seeding Randomness**: The combined seed is used to re-seed the random generator, ensuring that the same randomness state as in encryption is achieved.
3. **Byte Decryption**: Each encrypted byte is decrypted by subtracting the hashed mediator value from the byte and taking modulo 256 to retrieve the original byte values.

The function then attempts to convert the bytes back into the original message string.

## Code Walkthrough

### `mediator_term()`

This function creates the unique mediator key based on the message and universal seed bytes, as well as the fractal interactions. The mediator key is stored as a single structured string:

```python
mediator_key = f"{hashed_mediator_value}:{combined_seed}:{fractal_layers}"
```

### `generate_interactions()`

Generates 256 unique interactions by iterating over combinations of variables and applying both additive and multiplicative operations within the defined fractal layers.

### `encrypt_message()`

Encodes the message and then encrypts it using the mediator key:

```python
for byte in message_bytes:
    encrypted_byte = (byte + mediator_value) % 256
    encrypted_message.append(encrypted_byte)
```

### `decrypt_message()`

Reverses the encryption to restore the original message:

```python
for encrypted_byte in encrypted_message:
    decrypted_byte = (encrypted_byte - mediator_value) % 256
    decrypted_message.append(decrypted_byte)
```

## Security Advantages

1. **Dynamic Complexity**: By adding fractal layers and mediator-based mappings, the encryption complexity scales exponentially, yielding a vast search space resistant to brute-force attacks.
2. **Quantum Resistance**: The recursive fractal structure and large keyspace make the encryption less vulnerable to quantum decryption algorithms.
3. **Compact Representation**: The hashed mediator term provides a secure and compact way to store encryption metadata, facilitating secure transmission.

## Conclusion

This encryption protocol combines recursive fractal scaling with a mediator-driven encryption process, achieving a balance between security, reversibility, and adaptability. It demonstrates potential as an alternative encryption approach that could withstand both classical and quantum threats.

By leveraging the properties of fractal structures and hashed mediators, this approach achieves a scalable, high-security protocol that stands apart from traditional encryption methods like AES-256, offering a larger search space and increased adaptability.
